To run this application you will need Apache Tomcat installed on your PC.
After cloning this repositry, you can run the tests by simply running the "test" task in gradle.

If you face issues doing this try the following:
- Run gradle clean (tasks > build > clean)
- Run "buildDependents" in gradle
- Run the Tomcat server manually in gradle by going tasks > gretty > appStart and then see if it boots up
- Restart Intellij after the first load when indexing completes, this somtimes causes an issue for us.
